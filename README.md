## About Me
My name is Carolyn Lupi and I recently just finished the full-stack bootcamp program provided by University of Miami. I have previously been working in finance for the last 8 years or so and have decided to pursue my passion for tech. Outside of my career, I love painting and live music. 

## Projects
During my bootcamp, we worked on many projects to be able to show our skills. I also am starting to work on personal projects as well. We used a range of softwares including React, HTML, Node, etc. I will come back to list my personal projects here once they are more in motion.
